        <p class="text">Kobe Bryant's rise to superstardom is still one of the most fascinating stories to unfold in the NBA. Bryant entered the league as a talented but inexperienced high school star. And by the end of his career, Kobe was known as one of the greatest to ever play the game of basketball.

            Bryant was the son of a basketball player and spent a time of his life growing up in Italy. From there, he returned to the US, where he spent his adolescence in Philadelphia. Eventually, he became one of the most exciting prospects in the high school basketball scene.
            
            Kobe's biggest weapon was his mentality. Bryant would never allow anyone to outdo him in any aspect of the game. Jay Williams revealed that Bryant once practiced for hours before a game, and told him that he wanted to show him that he was willing to work harder than him in order to succeed.</p><br>

            <img id="Kobe_young" src="https://static.tildacdn.com/tild3137-3035-4266-b961-613532646230/john-cox-primo-kobe-.jpeg">
            <p class="about_childhood">Kobe Bryant is a hereditary basketball player. In addition to excellent physical data and a remarkable talent for the game, nature also rewarded him with a good heredity. Bryant was born in Philadelphia on August 2, 1978. The fact is that when the boy was six years old, his family temporarily moved to Italy, where the father of the family continued his sports career. So the kid went to school in Italy, and he had to learn Italian, and at the same time Spanish. In Europe, Bryant was fond of basketball, which his father began to teach him at the age of three, and football. In subsequent interviews, the athlete admitted more than once that if he had stayed in Italy, he could have preferred a career as a football player. Among football idols, Kobe called Frank Rijkaard and Ronaldinho, and he always supported the Milan club. In 1991, the father of the family ended his career as a professional player and returned to the states with his family, where he took up coaching. Being a talented basketball coach, Joe did not forget to devote time to his son, who even then showed himself to be a promising basketball player.

                Koby trained daily, showing remarkable for the boy will to win and diligence. Here, the efforts of a professional father and the own character traits of the future champion, who proved to be an ardent perfectionist, have already affected: he had to become the best and maintain this status by any means.
                
                Many hours of training also made themselves felt; in four years, thanks to Kobe Bryant, the Lower Merion High School team went from frankly bad to the best in the state. Moreover, Kobe himself managed to achieve success: the young man scored 2,883 points, became the most productive player among school teams in the history of the state and received the title of the best school basketball player in America. In the first team, the athlete played under the numbers "24" and "33". From that moment on, Bryant's basketball career skyrocketed, and the player never regretted his desire to connect his life with professional sports.</p><br>

            <h2 id="sport">Sports career</h2> 
            <img id="Kobe_sport" src="https://www.pravilamag.ru/upload/img_cache/540/5408005025c090491a5ea3e2a2c05db3_cropped_666x441.webp">
            <p class="sport">In the sports biography of the Black Mamba, there were many ups, but not a single fall (except for numerous injuries). The best moments of the games in which he participated and, in fact, each time led his home team to victory, remained forever in the memory of fans and millions of fans. Young basketball players have been studying on these episodes for about twenty years. Twenty years is an era for an athlete, they leave big basketball much earlier, but Kobe held on to the last, remaining at the peak of his glory by an effort of will.

                During his professional career, "Black Mamba" has won many awards. Among them - 5 champion titles, twice won gold at the Olympic Games, won the US Championship. In addition, Bryant was named to the All-Star Game 18 times, the All-Star Team 15 times, and the NBA All-Star Defense Team 12 times. In 2015, Bryant was named the richest player in the NBA. His fortune at that time was estimated at $ 290 million, while the annual salary of a basketball player was $ 25 million.
                
                With the Los Angeles Lakers, Kobe Bryant proved to be a flamboyant shooting guard, and the Charlotte Hornets were in dire need of a center.
                
                It so happened that in the Lakers, Bryant played in tandem with another famous basketball player, the owner of many titles, Shaquille O'Neal. Together they brought their team three NBA championships in a row, from 2000 to 2002. Unfortunately, both players were born leaders, and on this basis, outright enmity began between them. O'Neal didn't want to give up his place as the team's winning symbol, and the Black Mamba couldn't put up with a supporting role. In the end, youth won: Shaquille moved to the Miami Heat in 2004, and Kobe became the main star of the Lakers.
                
                In the team, Kobe was assigned the 8th number, but already in 2006 the 24th number was vacated, which the basketball player took for himself in memory of his participation in the school team. After the end of the athlete's career, both of these numbers in the team were taken out of circulation.
                
                According to the basketball player, he mastered the technique of throwing with a deviation to perfection, studying the movement of a cheetah during a hunt from a video. Professionals also note Kobe Bryant's strictly vertical handling style, as well as the "T" shaped hand position and use of the index finger in the center of the ball. These nuances help the player control the throw at all levels.
                
                Talent and willpower allowed the Black Mamba to have one of the most brilliant careers in professional sports. He is rightfully considered the most productive player and is compared with Michael Jordan, whose records Kobe has always sought to break. By the way, Jordan himself admitted that if anyone can compare with him, then only Kobe Bryant.
                
                Four years after the end of his career, Kobe Bryant received the right to enter the NBA Hall of Fame.</p><br>

            <p class="motivation">Throughout his career, he used whatever adversity was put in front of him in order to get better. He would never take no for an answer, and would never allow himself to take shortcuts. In the end, Kobe always wanted to be better.<br>

                <i>“Growing up in Italy, when I first moved over there, I didn't speak Italian, I didn't have any friends. I had the game of basketball, and through sport, through soccer, I was able to make friends and build connections. But it was a lot of time spent alone. When I came back to the states, I wasn’t the most athletic kid. I couldn’t compete with these kids. They’re doing windmills and dunking backwards, and I’m happy to tap the back board. So, I had to look at it from a long term, because I wasn’t going to give up on the game. So, I had to say ‘okay, this year, I’m going to get better at that. Next year, this’. And then so forth and so on. And then patiently I was able to catch them. It’s the consistency of the work. Monday, get better. Tuesday, get better. Wednesday, get better. And you do that over a period of time, not 1 month or 2 months. It’s 3,4,5,6,7,8,9, 10 years. And then you get to where you want to go. Obsessiveness comes from something that you love. You really love it, you’ll go through fire for it, you’ll go through the ups and downs with it and you’ll just keep it at it because you love it so much. You make game-winning shots and it’s awesome. You come back the next and miss a game-winning shot and its misery. And then the next day comes and you’re back playing again, and you understand that life has a cyclical nature. Where it’s what you do on Monday it’s fantastic but then Tuesday is a bad day. But guess what? There’s Wednesday. Every day, it’s just constant improvement, constant curiosity, constantly getting better. The results don’t really matter. Look at how you deal with the inner challenges, the self-negotiation that takes place inside of our own heads. You start talking to yourself, ‘man, my knee is really sore right now. Maybe I’m doing too much’. I’m not negotiating myself. The deal was already made. I set out at the beginning of the summer and said ‘this is the training plan I’m doing. I signed that contract with myself, I’m doing it’. A lot of times I’ve seen players, even myself when I was younger being consumed by a particular fear. To the point where you’re saying “Okay, no, it’s not good to feel fear. I shouldn’t be nervous in this situation right now. It does nothing but grow. Emotions come and go, the important thing is to accept them all, to embrace them all. Then you can choose to do with them what you want versus being controlled by emotion. Don’t hide from it, you got to be able to look at it and deal with it head-on… It’s okay to fail because you’re going to be loved no matter what. And that doesn’t just mean basketball. It means anything in life.”</i><br>
                
                Fans reacted to this video, mostly noting how Kobe's motivation would always help motivate them to conquer the hurdles in their own lives. Bryant was truly an inspiration to so many NBA fans, as they all reacted.
                
                Kobe did not have it easy. He wasn't a particularly big player, by NBA standards at least. But he was very talented. On top of that, he was willing to put in the work and improve his game in a way that very few have shown the initiative to do.
                
                Kobe always worked hard to ensure that he put in a better performance than his previous game. This desire for self-improvement made Kobe one of the most dangerously determined players in the league, as he would put no limits on what he could or couldn't do.</p>
